ABSTRACT = {Oil spill is considered one of the main threats to marine and coastal environments. Efficient monitoring and early identification of oil slicks are vital for the corresponding authorities to react expediently, confine the environmental pollution and avoid further damage. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are commonly used for this objective due to their capability for operating efficiently regardless of the weather and illumination conditions. Black spots probably related to oil spills can be clearly captured by SAR sensors, yet their discrimination from look-alikes poses a challenging objective. A variety of different methods have been proposed to automatically detect and classify these dark spots. Most of them employ custom-made datasets posing results as non-comparable. Moreover, in most cases, a single label is assigned to the entire SAR image resulting in a difficulties when manipulating complex scenarios or extracting further information from the depicted content. To overcome these limitations, semantic segmentation with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is proposed as an efficient approach. Moreover, a publicly available SAR image dataset is introduced, aiming to consist a benchmark for future oil spill detection methods. The presented dataset is employed to review the performance of well-known DCNN segmentation models in the specific task. DeepLabv3+ presented the best performance, in terms of test set accuracy and related inference time. Furthermore, the complex nature of the specific problem, especially due to the challenging task of discriminating oil spills and look-alikes is discussed and illustrated, utilizing the introduced dataset. Results imply that DCNN segmentation models, trained and evaluated on the provided dataset, can be utilized to implement efficient oil spill detectors. Current work is expected to contribute significantly to the future research activity regarding oil spill identification and SAR image processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing technologies and machine learning (ML) algorithms play an increasingly important role in accurate detection and monitoring of oil spill slicks, assisting scientists in forecasting their trajectories, developing clean-up plans, taking timely and urgent actions, and applying effective treatments to contain and alleviate adverse effects. Review and analysis of different sources of remotely sensed data and various components of ML classification systems for oil spill detection and monitoring are presented in this study. More than 100 publications in the field of oil spill remote sensing, published in the past 10 years, are reviewed in this paper. The first part of this review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different sources of remotely sensed data used for oil spill detection. Necessary preprocessing and preparation of data for developing classification models are then highlighted. Feature extraction, feature selection, and widely used handcrafted features for oil spill detection are subsequently introduced and analyzed. The second part of this review explains the use and capabilities of different classical and developed state-of-the-art ML techniques for oil spill detection. Finally, an in-depth discussion on limitations, open challenges, considerations of oil spill classification systems using remote sensing, and state-of-the-art ML algorithms are highlighted along with conclusions and insights into future directions.},
